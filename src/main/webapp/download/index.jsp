<h2>Bukkit <small>Version: 0.1 for 1.3.1-R1.0</small></h2>
<p>Bukkit is an up-and-coming Minecraft Server mod that will completely change how running and modifying a Minecraft server is done - making managing and creating servers easier and providing more flexibility. Learning from the mistakes made by other mods, Bukkit aims to be different and fill the void left by them: built from the ground up we've focused on performance, ease-of-use, extreme customisability and better communication between the Team and, you, our users. The overall design of Bukkit has been inspired by other mods and our experience as Minecraft players just like yourselves, giving us a unique perspective and advantage going into the creation of the Bukkit Project.</p>

<h2>Workbench <small>Not Available</small></h2>
<p>Workbench is the working name of the official Minecraft API, currently in very early stages of development. Its goal is to provide a means of allowing anyone to pick up Minecraft and easily achieve any goal from modifying gameplay to creating utilities to overhauling the client's graphics.</p>

<h2>Spout <small>Not Available</small></h2>
<p>Spout, formerly BukkitContrib, is a framework to bridge the ever-widening chasm between single player mods, and multi-player Bukkit plugins. On its own, it does very little. Expect no changes beyond some interface enhancements and minor speed improvements on the client and moderate speed improvements on the server. Through it, Bukkit plugins can do the previously impossible.</p>
