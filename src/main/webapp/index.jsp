Using our server plugin, you are one command away from getting any plugin, at any version, anywhere. No more clunky Web UIs. No more hosting politics. Just straight-up, honest-to-goodness plugin management.</p>

You can register your plugin with our Web interface, choose a location for download, and after an approval process (which is only in-place to make sure your plugin is downloadable) your plugin will be instantly available to any server owner running mod-get.</p><%@ include file="/template/footer.jsp" %>
